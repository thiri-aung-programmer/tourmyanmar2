            <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myanmar,[a] officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar,[b] also known as Burma (the official name until 1989), is a country in Southeast Asia. It is the largest country by area in Mainland Southeast Asia,
                and has a population of about 54 million as of 2017.[10] Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its
                south and southwest. The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon (Rangoon). Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower
                Myanmar.[11] In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the
                country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period.
                The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese
                Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies and gained independence in 1948. Following a coup d'état in 1962, it became a military dictatorship
                under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. </p>

                <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burmese pagodas are stupas that typically house Buddhist relics, including relics associated with Buddha. Pagodas feature prominently in Myanmar's landscape, earning the country the moniker "land of pagodas."
                    According to 2016 statistics compiled by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, Myanmar is home to 1,479 pagodas exceeding 27 feet (8.2m) in height, a quarter of which are located in Sagaing Region. Several cities in the country,
                    including Mandalay and Bagan, are known for their abundance of pagodas. Pagodas are the site of seasonal pagoda festivals. Burmese pagodas are enclosed in a compound known as the aran (အာရာမ်, from Pali ārāma), with gateways called
                    mok (မုခ်, from Pali mukha) at the four cardinal directions. The platform surrounding a Burmese pagoda is called a yinbyin (ရင်ပြင်).In the Burmese language, pagodas are known by a number of various terms. The umbrella term phaya (ဘုရား,
                    pronounced [pʰəjá]), which derives from Sanskrit vara, refers to pagodas, images of the Buddha, as well as royal and religious personages, including the Buddha, kings, and monks.Zedi (စေတီ), which derives from Pali cetiya, specifically
                    refers to typically solid, bell-shaped stupas that may house relics. Pahto (ပုထိုး) refers to hollow square or rectangular buildings built to resemble caves, with chambers that house images of the Buddha. Burmese pagodas are distinguished
                    from kyaungs in that the latter are monasteries that house Buddhist monks.According to legend, the Gautama Buddha visited Dhanyawadi, the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a missionary mission to spread Buddhism.[7] During
                    the 26th anniversary of the King at the time, a devout Buddhist, the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples[7] landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town.[8] The King of Arakan, along with his Chief Queen Sandra
                    Mala (with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting), and an entourage of ministers, generals and officials, paid homage to the Buddha.[8] They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi (Sravasti), the King
                    insisted that he leave his image for people to worship.[8] For this purpose, the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation.[8] During this time Sakka (in Pāli, the ruler of the Tavatimsa, in sanskrit called Trāyastriṃśa)
                    one of the heavens in Buddhist cosmology, supported by his assistant Vissakamma (or Vishvakarman), moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people.[8] It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma
                    created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days.[8] After looking at his own lifelike image, believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness,[9] Buddha was pleased and "imbued the image
                    with his spiritual essence", or "enlivened and consecrated" the image, naming it "Candasara".[2] He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative.</p>

                        this temple, and originally came from Arakan. It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people's lives, as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha's life.Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses
                        of the Buddha made during his lifetime; two were in India, two in paradise, and the fifth is the Mahamuni Image in Myanmar.Legend holds that the Buddha himself visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC.King Sanda Thuriya
                        requested that an image be cast of him. Once complete, the Buddha breathed upon it, and thereafter the image took on his exact likenessAccording to legend, the Gautama Buddha visited Dhanyawadi, the capital city of Arakan during

                    <p class="pSize1"> The Shwezigon Pagoda or Shwezigon Paya (ရွှေစည်းခုံဘုရား [ɕwèzíɡòʊɰ̃ pʰəjá]) is a Buddhist stupa located in Nyaung-U, Myanmar. A prototype of Burmese stupas, it consists of a circular gold leaf-gilded stupa surrounded by smaller temples
                        and shrines. Construction of the Shwezigon Pagoda began during the reign of King Anawrahta (r. 1044–1077), the founder of the Pagan Empire, in 1059–1060 and was completed in 1102, during the reign of his son King Kyansittha. Over
                        the centuries the pagoda had been damaged by many earthquakes and other natural calamities, and has been refurbished several times. In recent renovations it has been covered by more than 30,000 copper plates. However, the lowest
                        level terraces have remained as they were. This pagoda, a sacred Buddhist religious place, is believed to enshrine a bone and tooth of Gautama Buddha. The pagoda is in the form of a cone formed by five square terraces with a central
                        solid core. There are footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here. Jataka legends are depicted on glazed terra-cotta tiles set into three rectangular terraces. At the entrance of the pagoda there are large statues of
                        guardians of the temple. There are also four bronze standing statues of Buddha which are stated to be of the current age Buddha. At the outer limits of the pagoda there are 37 nats deified along with an intricately carved wooden
                        sculpture of Thagyamin, Burmese version of Indian god Indra. Within the compound of the Shwezigon Pagoda there is a stone pillar containing Mon language inscriptions dedicated by Kyansittha. </a>

                        and also known as the Great Dagon Pagoda and the Golden Pagoda is a gilded stupa located in Yangon, Myanmar. The Shwedagon is the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar, as it is believed to contain relics of the four previous
                        Buddhas of the present kalpa. These relics include the staff of Kakusandha, the water filter of Koṇāgamana, a piece of the robe of Kassapa, and eight strands of hair from the head of Gautama.[2] Built on the 51-metre (167ft) high
                        Singuttara Hill, the 112m (367ft) tall pagoda stands 170m (560ft) above sea level,[note 1] and dominates the Yangon skyline. Yangon's zoning regulations, which cap the maximum height of buildings to 127 metres (417 feet) above
                        sea level (75% of the pagoda's sea level height), ensure the Shwedagon's prominence in the city's skyline.ccording to tradition, the Shwedagon Pagoda was constructed more than 2,500 years ago, which would make it the oldest Buddhist
                        stupa in the world.[4] The story goes that two merchant brothers Tapussa and Bhallika met the Gautama Buddha during his lifetime and received eight strands of the Buddha's hairs. The brothers presented the eight strands of hair
                        to King Okkalapa of Dagon who enshrined the strands along with some relics of the three preceding Buddhas of the Gautama Buddha in a stupa on the Singuttara Hill in present-day Myanmar.[5] Scene upon the terrace of the Great Dagon
                        Pagoda, 1824–1826 The first mention of the pagoda in the royal chronicles dates only to 1362/63 CE (724 ME) when King Binnya U of Martaban–Hanthawaddy raised the pagoda to 18m (59ft). Contemporary inscriptional evidence, the Shwedagon
                        Pagoda Inscriptions from the reign of King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy (r. 1471–1492), shows a list of repairs of the pagoda going back to 1436. In particular, Queen Shin Saw Pu (r. 1454–1471) raised its height to 40m (130ft), and
                        gilded the new structure. By the beginning of the 16th century, Shwedagon Pagoda had become the most famous Buddhist pilgrimage site in Burma. </a>
