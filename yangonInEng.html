            </h3>
            <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yangon (Burmese: ရန်ကုန်; pronounced [jàɰ̃ɡòʊɰ̃ mjo̰]; lit. 'End of Strife'), formerly spelled as Rangoon, is the capital of the Yangon Region and the largest city of Myanmar (also known as Burma). Yangon served
                as the capital of Myanmar until 2006, when the military government relocated the administrative functions to the purpose-built capital city of Naypyidaw in north central Myanmar. With over 7 million people, Yangon is Myanmar's most populous
                city and its most important commercial centre. Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia,and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact.The colonial-era commercial core is centered
                around the Sule Pagoda, which is reputed to be over 2,000 years old. The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda – Myanmar's most sacred and famous Buddhist pagoda. Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure, especially
                compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia, such as Jakarta, Bangkok or Hanoi. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue
                to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yangon is located in Lower Burma (Myanmar) at the convergence of the Yangon and Bago Rivers about 30 km (19 mi) away from the Gulf of Martaban at 16°48' North, 96°09' East (16.8, 96.15). Its standard time zone
                is UTC/GMT +6:30 hours. 23 meters above sea level. Due to its location on the Irrawaddy Delta, intertidal flat ecosystems occur adjacent to the city.Yangon has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification system.[36]
                The city features a lengthy wet season from May through October where a substantial amount of rainfall is received; and a dry season from November through April, where little rainfall is seen. It is primarily due to the heavy rainfall
                received during the rainy season that makes Yangon fall under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of year 1961 to 1990s, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from 29 to 36 °C (84 to
                97 °F) and average lows ranging from 18 to 25 °C (64 to 77 °F). </p>

            <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yangon is the most populous city by far in Myanmar. According to the 2014 census, the city had a population of 5.16 million.[77] The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous
                Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s.[citation needed] Immigrants have
                founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown
                number of civil servants away from Yangon. Yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While Indians formed the slight majority prior to World War II,[21] today, the majority of the population is of indigenous Bamar (Burman)
                descent. Large communities of Indians/South Asian Burmese and the Chinese Burmese exist, especially in the traditional downtown neighborhoods. A large number of Rakhine and Karen also live in the city. </p>

    <h4 class="pagodaTitle">AD-6 To 19 Century</h4>
    <p class="pSize2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yangon was founded as Dagon in the early 11th century (c. 1028–1043) by the Mon people, who inhabited Lower Burma at that time.[10] Dagon became an important pilgrimage pagoda town, starting in the 14th century, during
        the Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Notable governors of Dagon included Princess Maha Dewi, who ruled the town from 1364 to 1392,[11] and her grandniece, Shin Saw Pu, who later became the only female queen regnant in Burmese history. Queen Saw Pu built a
        palace next to the Shwedagon Pagoda in the town in 1460 and spent her semi-retired life at that palace until her death in 1471.[12][13] In 1755, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the Konbaung Dynasty captured Dagon, added settlements around it,
        and called the enlarged town "Yangon". In the 1790s, the East India Company opened a factory in Yangon. The estimated population of Yangon in 1823 was about 30,000.[14] The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26),
        but returned the city to Burmese rule after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.</a>

    <h4 class="pagodaTitle">Colonial Rangoon (1852–1948)</h4>

    <p class="pSize2"> The British captured Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. After the war, the British moved the capital of British Burma from
        Moulmein (present-day Mawlamyine) to Yangon.[16][17] Based on the design by army engineer Lt. Alexander Fraser, the British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land, bounded to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west
        by the Yangon River. Yangon became the capital of all British-ruled Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential
        suburbs to the north of Royal Lake (Kandawgyi) and Inya Lake.[18] The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University. Yangon was the city where the British sent Bahadur Shah II,
        the last Mughal emperor, to live in exile after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.Colonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as "the garden city of the East."[18] By
        the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.[20] Before World War II, about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian, and only about a third was Bamar (Burman).[21] Karens, Chinese,
        Anglo-Burmese and others made up the rest.[citation needed] After World War I, Yangon became the center of the Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against British rule
        in 1920, 1936, and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under Japanese occupation (1942–45), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the Allies in May 1945. Yangon became the capital of the Union of Burma on 4 January
        1948 when the country gained independence from British rule.</a>

    <h4 class="pagodaTitle">Contemporary Yangon (1948–present)</h4>

    <p class="pSize2">
        Soon after Burma's independence in 1948, many colonial-era names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the military junta changed the city's English name to "Yangon", along with many other changes in English transliteration
        of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications and news bureaus, including, most notably, the BBC and foreign nations including the United Kingdom
        and the United States.)[23][24] Since independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa in the 1950s to Hlaingthaya, Shwepyitha and South Dagon in the
        1980s.[15] Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly 600 square kilometres (230 sq mi). Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise
        hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls,[25] leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the Yangon City Heritage List in 1996.[26] Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five
        new highways linking the city to its industrial back country.[27][28][29] Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection. Yangon has become much more indigenous Burmese
        in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win's xenophobic government.[21] Nevertheless, sizeable South Asian and
        Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups. </a>

                Under British rule, Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of Yangon, the new capital of British Burma. The city suffered extensive destruction during the Japanese conquest of Burma in the Second World
